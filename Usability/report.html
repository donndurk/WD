		<h3>Initial Thoughts</h3>
		<p>Manchester United are notorious for a having a poorly designed website, that is neither modern nor stylish, and my first impression was no different. This is not a site which is up to the standard of an organisation worth over a billion dollars. The layout is claustrophobic and everything feels squashed together as if they had no space at all. Some of the pictures on the page are the worst offenders, where it can be difficult to tell who some of the players are in them.</p>
		<p>The site does not make it easy to process the information shown, which leads to a negative first impression. The homepage for a team of this stature should be vibrant and well laid out, with larger images than the ones that are currently in place. The main objective should be to hook fans into the content, and get them interested in the club. Oversaturation of content achieves the exact opposite goal. The average user won’t want to spend time sifting through uninteresting articles to find the information that they want.</p>

		<h3>Visual Perception</h3>
		<p>Now to move on to the specifics of the problems. The default text size is simply too small. As someone who is lucky enough to have relatively perfect eyesight, I find it quite difficult to be able to quickly focus on the text. This makes finding the information you require all the more tricky. I don’t think that it is reasonable to expect the user to have to change the text size on their browser manually. We want users to enjoy using websites. We don’t want them to have to struggle with making it usable for themselves. We are the developers afterall, not them.</p>
		<p>Next on the redesign block is the awful “Today on manutd.com” carousel. This is likely to be the first thing you process on the web page, due to its location and the fact that its content is changing regularly, which attracts the eye. While I think the idea is good in theory, the execution is quite a bit off. Firstly, I don’t think there should be any whitespace on the right-hand side of it. They do a good job of keeping the content uniformly laid out down the page, but this sticks out like a sore thumb. The best solution, in my opinion, would be to stretch it to line up with the content below, have the image on the left side of the container and the title and preview line on the right side, with the former over the latter. </p>
		<p>The next issue I have with the carousel is the rate at which the content changes. Between looking at the image and looking at the text, the user is not given enough time to take in the information being portrayed before more is being shoved at them. A good solution to the would be to simply stop the carousel when the mouse was being hovered over it. Another design flaw is having to wait the entire duration for it to do a full loop to get back to where it was. This is frustrating as you may only want to read the preview to see if it might be an article worth reading, and clicking the relevant item in the list will immediately bring you to that page. Again, I believe the best solution would be to implement another hover feature, where the item that was being hovered over would immediately be displayed on the carousel, until such time that the mouse was moved off of it. These changes would give the user a lot more control over the content that they were browsing, and the interactive side would make the website more engaging.</p>
		<p>The last big issue I have with the website is the nav bar on the left side. To put it simply, there are too many links. There is overlap between several items in it, and this could be implemented more efficiently by either removing links that overlap, or using a “dropdown” menu of sorts. Anything that decreases the amount of content visible is a good thing in this case, so either is an acceptable option. The “Investor Relations” at the bottom of the nav is a great example of what the site could and should probably be, but it might need a small colour re-scheme. This site does a much better job of presenting its information. It makes use of dropdown menus, and the font size is much larger which helps with information retention.</p>

		<h3>A New Look</h3>
		<p>The goal was to keep the site as simple as possible, basically the exact opposite to what was already in place. I tried to make good use of whitespace in my redesign. Having whitespace on either side of the page focuses our eyes to the center, and avoids the distractions that plague manutd.com. This helped to achieve the simplicity that I wanted, while also allowing users to more easily focus on the information that is displayed so that they can quickly find what they’re looking for.</p>
		<p>In my redesign, I tried to implement several of the features I talked about above. The font size is bigger and the nav is more usable with a dropdown menu. I decided against using a carousel, instead opting for clickable article previews which display the articles on-page, without the need for loading a new page. They display in a resizable box, which is helpful as a narrower container for the text leads to the appearance of long chunks of text. By changing the container, this is no longer the case, and users are much less likely to skim over the words that they are reading, meaning their information retention will be greater. </p>

		<h3>Conclusion</h3>
		<p>Do I think manutd.com is the worst website in the world? No. However it is not a website that caters to all users, with or without a disability. The small text, combined with the busy layout is not visually pleasing, and as a result it is difficult to navigate efficiently even for the most experienced user. I believe that the small changes that I made would be well suited to the website, and will make it less of an ordeal to use.</p>
